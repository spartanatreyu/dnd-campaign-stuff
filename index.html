		<h1>DM's Forward</h1>
		<br>

		<p>Below is a one page about the setting. I’ve tried to make it interesting to read hope you enjoy.</p>

		<h2>What happens when we meet?</h2>
		<br>

		<p>We’re going to decide who we’re playing and what we’re doing. The main question I have is. Whose ship is this and why do they have it. I’m especially interested if one of you is the captain.</p>

		<p class="printed-text push-right">A frigate loaded with spices from half a world away, meets its fate at a band of enterprising thieves. Taking the, ship, its guns and its cargo, leaving the crew on a small fishing vessel. A large ship with a wealthy crew, evades capture and terrorises the Dominian seas. </p>

		<p class="printed-text">In the dead of night, aboard a two sail sloop, a band of rebels flee the aftermath of the trans-atlantic civil war. Criminals in the eyes of both Dominia and Straad they sale the Orient seas, offering safe haven and honest work to the upheaved and downtrodden.</p>

		<p class="printed-text push-left">The Elizabeth, small but opulent. Three sales, a dozen guns, and a banqueting cabin. Tasked with only the most noble of objectives, discover and document. A voyage not for the feint hearted, promising new lands and dangers to those brave enough to serve their Kingdom.</p>

		<p class="printed-text">A crew needs a voyage as synonymous as a voyage needing a ship. Who is the captain of your vessel? What reason have they eschewed the comforts of dry land for the dangerous and mystical seas? When we get together to make characters, I want to hear the history of the ship and its crew.</p>

		<p>Obviously I have ideas of my own, but I really want you guys to have creative freedom making your characters. I want to see what kind of adventures you want to play in. The above are just examples.</p>

		<p>The restraints are simple. You have to play a character who has good reason to serve on a ship.</p>

		<p>When you serve on the ship you need to fulfil a role, helmsman, able seaman, maybe a physician. And if your character is on the ship, do they have anyone with them? Siblings, partners, friends? </p>

		<p>Each of your characters can be level 1 – 4. Level one characters might have unofficial training, level two characters formal training, but level three and four your character has to have done something. Served in a war, gone on a great voyage, or something more. If you want to play a higher level character I’m going to need backstory on how they got to where they are.</p>

		<p>As for what classes you can play. Anything is up for grabs but one of the themes of the setting is all magic is tied to the ocean. So keep that in mind. I’m also happy to work with you for homebrew classes. If it means we get to tell a better story I’m all for it.</p>

		<p>Races! I love DnD races but I tend not to like that you chose a race to benefit your class. For this reason racial modifiers are going to work differently. I’ll try to upload a document about race soon. For those curious, Humans and Orcs are the most prominent races.</p>

		<p>There’s also changes to how some spells work but I’ll talk more about that if you’re interested in playing a caster. The two big changes, no spells that use fire, and healing spells will work a bit differently.</p>

		<p>I look forward to seeing all of you. PLEASE ask me any questions you have.</p>

		<h1>Pocket guide to Seas</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>Gods, Oceans and Magic:</h2>
		<br>

		<p>The Gods, like us, desire land. The lands of the realm are claimed for Gods, by us. For claiming soil, the Gods will make it fertile, for claiming mountains we are rewarded with treasures of the earth.</p>

		<p>But the Gods cannot claim the Oceans. Lakes, rivers and coasts the Gods will make rich with fish and fine minerals but the Oceans are godless and lawless. It is believed that all ills come from the Ocean. Harsh weather, foreign raiders, and magic.</p>

		<h2>The Geo-political climate:</h2>
		<br>

		<p>The aggressor of the first age gave the nations of our realm a common enemy, always the people could be united against the Sea-Folk, the mythic raiders from the icy north. Responsible for the fall of the first and second age.</p>

		<p class="quote">“Myself against my brother, my brother and I against our cousin, my cousin, my brother and I against the stranger. This is how it has always been.”</p>

		<p class="quote" style="text-align: right;">~~ Callissa General of the Southern Colonies </p>

		<p>As soon as our new enemy falls, we will realise how close we stand to our old ones and carnage will erupt. But none will be ready for war so soon, so like pieces on a game board the weaker of us will be bartered for and traded.  This is the concern of the free people. That even as the great Queens and Kings gather to make treaties their eyes fall to unclaimed treasures.</p>

		<p>The Raiders where held back. Victory, celebration, and an uneasy alliance. The Three greatest powers; The Holy Queendom of Straad; The United Dominian Kingdoms; and the Wuxan Empire split the northern nations amongst themselves as they saw fit.</p>

		<h2>Recent History in the Holy Queendom of Straad &amp; the Dominian Kingdoms:</h2>
		<br>

		<p>“Independence” a voice shouted over a crowd of four hundred soldiers. “How many of us must die in foreign wars before we have paid our forefathers blood debt?” her voice was clear, reaching even those in the furthest rank. “How many raids must we defend before we can say the land is ours?” they were steel faced, remorseful yet driven. “What hour will the empire fall and take with it all of us, who have slaved and suffered and survived.” she unsheathes her rapier and all drew their rapiers with her. “We are the last generation of the empire!  We are the mothers and fathers of a free people!” with her final call the 400 able seaman let out a rallying cry.</p>

		<p>The northern colonies heard this speech, their patriots and oppressed natives stood side by side ready for a civil war. Across the oceans an alliance of free peoples was made. Only seven years later the war was over. And now the Free People are no more. Governments where replaced, and all debts of the rebellion where forgiven in exchange for an absolute surrender.</p>

		<h2>The Wuxan Empire &amp; the Orient Sea:</h2>
		<br>

		<p>Even as Straad and Dominia expanding ever outwards, the Wu-Xan Empire has always focused on its peoples and lands, with little interest beyond its coasts and small islands. And where the eyes of governments fall away, the eyes of outlaws are drawn.</p>

		<p>The Pirate Confederation, led by Cheng I Sao, employ mercenaries, smugglers and thieves they control the coasts and all foreign trade. Sailing through the Orient Sea you will deal with them. They will give you a choice, friend or fodder?</p>

		<p>Wuxan is the only empire that permits the mystic arts. But only under the empire’s watchful eye.</p>
